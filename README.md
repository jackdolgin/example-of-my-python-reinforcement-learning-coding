This repository is for code analyzing and simulating reinforcement learning models for a cognitive psychology task called the 2-step task. The `shcripts` folder contains scripts to parallelize the analyses. `shcripts/run_all_jobs.sh` creates an array of jobs to a cluster, with each job calling `shcripts/run_one_job.sh` to implement that job by hooking into `py_scripts/run_wrapper.py`. This python script receives a number as an input from the shell script and retrieves the corresponding row number in a csv of parameters, which is generated by `prep_params_for_cluster.py`.  `py_scripts/run_wrapper.py` then inputs the row's parameters into `py_scripts/wrapper.py`, which in turn calls `py_scripts/simulate_and_model.py` to carry out the reinforcement learning simulations and model fitting.
